# Ordering tracker

General idea of this project is to helps team in internal collaboration on quoting / ordering all components and custom toolings against Solid Works cad model.

My first gole on this project is to beable to present on single page all active orders with ability to see more details on single order detail page.
Main idea of building this internal aplication is learn django ( framework written in python ) by working on real aplication.

From architectural point on the begining application is design as a monilite django.
Deployment plan is to use caprover project to speed up deploying ( with direct link to github repository - main branch )
Also the data will be storaged on managed db on Postgress.
